React.js Workshop with Ryan Florence

You will need

```
git clone https://github.com/FrontendMasters/2015-02-13-React.git
cd 2015-02-13-React
npm install
npm start

Then visit http://localhost:8080.

This runs the webpack dev server, any changes you make to javascript
files in `excercises` will cause the browser to reload live.
