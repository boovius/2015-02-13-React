React.js Workshop with Ryan Florence
====================================

You will need

```
git clone https://github.com/FrontendMasters/2015-02-13-React.git
cd 2015-02-13-React
npm install
npm start

Then visit http://localhost:8080.

This runs the webpack dev server, any changes you make to javascript
files in `excercises` will cause the browser to reload live.

React Intro:
- follow the install instructions on your readme ^^ and not on his
readme on the screen- there is a typo that he addresses.
- the file that he works on (ex 0) is not on the repo; meant for 
you to just watch and not code along.  He will explain in a bit
React Intro Questions: no notes
JSX vs JavaScript functions:
- Javascript functions: When React creates UI, it creates objs that rep html.  The elements with arguments.  A series of functions embeded in each other
- JSX: you pass in blocks of html in a function.  React will turn the html into function calls that resembles the Javascript functions. Parens on the right side optional.
- The people who look at React as a platform use Javascript but normally people use JSX; no performance tradeoffs with either one.
